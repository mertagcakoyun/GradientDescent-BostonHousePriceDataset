# GradientDescent on Boston House Price Dataset

In this project, the cost (MSE) function’s Gradient and Gradient Vector are tried to be calculate. After that a Linear Regression algorithm is implemented by using
gradient descent with different learning rates. Implementation of gradient descent function on Boston House Price Dataset..
## What is gradient descent? 
Gradient descent is an optimization algorithm used to minimize some function by iteratively moving in the direction of steepest descent as defined by the negative of the gradient. In machine learning, we use gradient descent to update the parameters of our model.So we used Gradient Descent for minimize our cost function.

## The Boston Housing Dataset
The Boston Housing Dataset is a derived from information collected by the U.S. Census Service concerning housing in the area of Boston MA. The following describes the dataset columns; 
  
  ● CRIM - per capita crime rate by town
  
  ● ZN - proportion of residential land zoned for lots over 25,000 sq.ft.
  
  ● INDUS - proportion of non-retail business acres per town.
  
  ● CHAS - Charles River dummy variable (1 if tract bounds river; 0 otherwise)
  
  ● NOX - nitric oxides concentration (parts per 10 million)
  
  ● RM - average number of rooms per dwelling
  
  ● AGE - proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940
  
  ● DIS - weighted distances to five Boston employment centres
  
  ● RAD - index of accessibility to radial highways
  
  ● TAX - full-value property-tax rate per $10,000
  
  ● PTRATIO - pupil-teacher ratio by town
  
  ● B - 1000(Bk - 0.63)^2 where Bk is the proportion of blacks by town
  
  ● LSTAT - % lower status of the population
  
  ● MEDV - Median value of owner-occupied homes in $1000's

-There are 506 Instances.Number of Attributes: 13 numeric/categorical predictive. Median Value (attribute 14) is usually the target.
